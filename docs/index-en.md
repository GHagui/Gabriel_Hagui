# Welcome

Software engineering, AWS Cloud, serverless architecture, automation, and a pinch of homelab tinkering – all presented in a direct, accessible, opinionated *neubrutalist* theme.

I'm a software engineer focused on modernizing legacy systems, building distributed/cloud-native solutions and creating lean automation that unlocks real efficiency. Being deaf since birth shaped how I communicate: clear, asynchronous and intentional. That mindset informs this site’s structure – sharp contrast, concise sections, fast scanning.

## Purpose
This site is my personal hub. Here I:

- **Document real migration & modernization work** on **AWS**.
- **Share learnings** about serverless, Python automation and clean architecture.
- **Showcase projects** (open source, experiments, homelab / TrueNAS / self-hosted infra).
- **Highlight developer productivity tooling** (e.g., Everything search, Flow Launcher) that meaningfully improves daily flow.
- **Publish my resume** and professional context for collaboration and opportunities.
- **Provide a clear contact path** for ideas, proposals or contributions.

---
## What you'll find
- Technical articles (Cloud, Serverless, Infra, Developer Productivity)
- Practical narratives (homelab evolution, storage, personal observability)
- Projects & experiments under version control
- Reusable patterns, checklists and snippets
- A living professional journey

---
## Recent highlights
- Migration & validation of critical .NET routines to AWS with zero functional divergence.
- Anti-corruption layer and **AWS Lambda (Python)** functions (100% unit test coverage) optimized on ARM for cost.
- Internal automation improving review speed and governance consistency.
- From “just storage” to a **homelab** powered by TrueNAS and self-hosted services.
- Productivity series: instant file discovery with **Everything** + fast app launching via **Flow Launcher**.

## Why the Neubrutalist look?
Strong contrast, solid borders and direct typography emphasize content over ornament. The aesthetic also improves accessibility and scan speed across displays.
