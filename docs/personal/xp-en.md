## **About Me**

I am a Software Engineer focused on creating and modernizing large-scale distributed systems within the AWS ecosystem. I am driven by complex challenges and the opportunity to build efficient, business-impactful solutions. My career at Itaú Unibanco has been marked by my autonomy in leading critical projects and co-founding a new cloud-native squad, where I've been involved from architectural design to production delivery.

As someone who is Deaf from birth, I have developed highly precise asynchronous communication skills and a resilient, creative approach to problem-solving. My goal is to continue applying and expanding my skills in serverless architecture, Python, and automation, collaborating with high-performance teams to deliver cutting-edge technology.

## **Projects & Achievements at Itaú Unibanco**

Since November 2022, I have been contributing to the bank's technological evolution by working on modernization projects and creating new cloud-native solutions.

### **Initiative: Modernization and Migration of Critical Applications to the AWS Cloud**
_(Recognized with the **High-Performance Bonus Program (PRAD) 2024** award)_

In this project, I led the successful migration of over **30 critical routines** from a legacy environment (.NET Framework, Batch Files) to the AWS cloud. My key contributions included:

-   **Technical Leadership and Validation:** I led the entire testing and validation process to ensure a migration with zero functional discrepancies, managing **EC2** instance configurations and overall environment validation.
-   **Reverse Engineering and Incident Resolution:** Faced with a lack of documentation, I reverse-engineered the on-premises environment to map the system's behavior, becoming the focal point for resolving critical incidents during the transition phase.
-   **Software Development:** I developed new routines in **.NET Core** to replace obsolete batch processes, delivering code that was more modular, secure, and configurable, with **100% unit test coverage**, exceeding the company's quality assurance standards.
-   **Governance and Change Management:** I orchestrated over **50 Change Management tickets (GMUDs)**, ensuring compliance and security throughout the deployment process to the production environment.

### **Initiative: Founding a New Cloud-Native Platform (Anti-Corruption Layer)**

As a founding member of a new squad, I was responsible for developing high-performance solutions from scratch in the AWS cloud.

-   **Serverless Architecture and Development:** I designed and implemented over **10 Lambda functions (Python)** using **ARM architecture** to optimize performance and cost. I ensured the robustness of integrations with SQS, S3, RabbitMQ, and Step Functions by achieving **100% unit test coverage**.
-   **SRE Culture and Quality Assurance:** I pioneered the creation and maintenance of the squad's architectural and project documentation. I also implemented a rigorous **Code Review** process focused on quality and security (SonarQube, VeraCode), raising the technical standard of the team's deliverables.
-   **Innovation and AI-Powered Automation:** I developed two automation tools that became benchmarks for team efficiency:
    -   **Automated Technical Documentation:** A tool that generates and updates technical documentation automatically from **GitHub** repository metadata.
    -   **AI-Generated User Manuals:** A process using **StackSpot** and AI to create user manuals from demo videos and their transcripts, **drastically reducing manual effort and delivery time**.
